    To remember the logic of finding the missing `k`th number from a sorted array, let's break it down into a simple and memorable explanation:

### Problem:
You have a sorted array `vec` of size `n` that might have missing numbers in a sequence. You need to find the `k`th missing number.

### Concept:
- Imagine you are counting numbers from `1` to some large number.
- If no numbers were missing, the count would naturally be continuous.
- However, when you encounter a number in the array, it tells you that some numbers before it might be missing.
- The goal is to find which number should be in the missing `k`th position.

### Key Idea (Intuition):
- **Move forward**: As you go through the array, check if the current number (`vec[i]`) is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, that means this number is not missing, so **increase `k`** to find the next missing one.
- **Stop when there's a gap**: As soon as you find a number in the array that is larger than `k`, you know the `k`th missing number is right there, because the gap starts.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Start with `k`**: Youâ€™re trying to find the `k`th missing number.
2. **Iterate through the array**: Go through each number in the sorted array.
3. **Compare with `k`**:
   - If `vec[i]` (current number) is less than or equal to `k`, that means this number is not missing, so move `k` up to look for the next missing number.
   - If `vec[i]` is larger than `k`, this indicates you've found the gap where the `k`th missing number lies, so return `k`.
4. **Return the final value of `k`**: If the loop completes and all the numbers are smaller than or equal to `k`, the missing number you're looking for is still `k`.

### Code:
```cpp
int missingK(vector<int> vec, int n, int k) {
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(vec[i] <= k) {
            k++;  // This number is not missing, so move to the next missing one.
        } else {
            return k;  // Found the gap, return the missing number.
        }
    }
    return k;  // If no gap was found, return the current value of k.
}
```

### How to Remember:
1. **Imagine a race**: Think of the numbers in the array as runners in a race. The `k` value is the missing runner you're looking for.
2. **Start counting**: Each time a runner (number in the array) is ahead or tied with `k`, you know that this runner isn't missing, so move to the next.
3. **Look for the gap**: When you find a number that's ahead of `k` (a gap in the race), that's where your missing runner should be.

By visualizing it this way, you can easily recall that you're incrementing `k` each time there's no gap, and stopping as soon as you find the gap. This approach will help you remember the algorithm for a long time!
